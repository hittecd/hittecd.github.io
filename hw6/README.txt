Special Features:

The phone can compute swipes up, down, left and right. This is accomplished by saving the position that the mouse was pressed down. As the mouse is moved relative to the down position, the theta from the origin is calculated by taking the arctan(dx / dy) = theta.

When the gesture tab is selected and the mouse cursor is outside its bounds, the state will change to undefined.
